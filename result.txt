hi good evening everyone today I am here to speak about artificial intelligence a branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human like intelligence artificial intelligence is the ability of the computer program for machine to think and it is also field of study which tries to make computer smart they work on their own without being in coated with, John mccarthy what came up with name artificial intelligence in 1955 in general use the term artificial intelligence means of machine which mimics human cognition at least some of things we associate with the other Minds such as learning problem solving can be done by computers do not in the same way as me to address capital and Michael henderland define as systems ability to correctly interrupt external data to learn from Satta Tata and to use the learning to achieve specific goal and staff through flexible aadami an ideal intelligent machine is a flexible edit agent which receives its environment and takes action to maximize its chance of success at some good as muscles become increasing the capable mental facilities one-third to require intelligence are removed from the definition for example optical character recognition is no longer received as an example of at artificial intelligence it is just a routine Technology at present we use the term for successful in understanding human speed can tempting at high level in strategy game system self driving Cars interpreting Complex data some people also considered as a danger to humanity if it is called used to progress at its current affairs and extreme goal of a research is to create computer programs that can learn solve problem think logically in practice however most applications have big on problem with computer and do while searching data bases and doing calculations are things computer do better than people on the other hand receiving its environment in any real sense is way beyond present day computing in was many different fields of Computer Science Mathematics linguistics and psychology neuroscience and philosophy eventually researcher hop to create a General artificial intelligence which can solve many problems instead of boxing on what on just one researches are also trying to create creative and emotional which can possibly empathize and creator many approaches and tools have been tried borrowing from the management literature
